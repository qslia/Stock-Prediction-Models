Great question 👏 —
let’s unpack what `remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master` means.

---

### 🧩 What it is

`remotes/origin/HEAD` is a **symbolic reference** (a pointer) that tells Git:

> “Which branch should be considered the *default* branch for the remote `origin`?”

So in your screenshot:

```
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
```

means:

> The default branch on the remote `origin` (your GitHub fork) is `master`.

It’s **not a real branch** — it’s just a pointer used by Git tools and some commands to know what the “main branch” is on the remote.

---

### 🧠 Why it matters

When you clone a repo, Git automatically creates:

```
origin/HEAD -> origin/<default-branch>
```

based on the default branch setting on GitHub (e.g., `master` or `main`).

If later the remote changes its default branch (say from `master` → `main`), your local Git may still have the old pointer until you fetch again.

---

### 🔧 How to view or change it

**View the symbolic reference:**

```bash
git remote show origin
```

You’ll see something like:

```
HEAD branch: master
```

**Change it manually (rarely needed):**

```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```

This command updates your local `origin/HEAD` to match whatever the remote currently says is the default branch on GitHub.

Or, if you want to set it manually:

```bash
git remote set-head origin master
```

or

```bash
git remote set-head origin main
```

| `origin/HEAD -> origin/master` | The default branch on the remote is `master` |

Would you like me to explain how to **switch your fork’s default branch** on GitHub (e.g., from `master` to `main` or to your `my-work` branch)?

<br><br>

Perfect 👍 let’s go through how to **switch your fork’s default branch on GitHub** step-by-step — this will change what
`remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/...` points to.

---

## 🧭 Goal

You want to make your GitHub fork’s default branch (and therefore `origin/HEAD`) point to a different branch — for example, from `master` → `my-work`.

---

## 🧰 Option 1: Change the default branch on GitHub (the official way)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub (for example:
   `https://github.com/qsliia/Stock-Prediction-Models`)

2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** tab (you’ll see it near “Insights” on the top bar).

3. In the left sidebar, click **“Branches”**.

4. At the top, under **Default branch**, click the **✏️ (Edit)** button.

5. Select the new branch you want — e.g. `my-work`.

6. Click **Update** → confirm the change.

✅ Done!
Now your GitHub fork’s default branch is `my-work`.

---

## 🧩 Option 2: Update your local Git pointer (optional sync)

After changing it on GitHub, update your local `origin/HEAD` pointer:

```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```

That will automatically update:

```
remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/my-work
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

* This change **does not delete or merge** anything — it only affects:

  * The branch GitHub shows by default (when visiting your repo)
  * The branch that `git clone` uses by default
  * Your local `origin/HEAD` pointer

* You can still manually check out `master` or any other branch whenever you want:

  ```bash
  git checkout master
  git checkout my-work
  ```

---

Would you like me to show how to **sync your fork’s new default branch (`my-work`)** with the upstream repo, so it stays up to date automatically?
