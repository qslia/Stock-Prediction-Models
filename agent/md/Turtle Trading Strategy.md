These two lines implement the **Turtle Trading Strategy** - a famous trend-following breakout strategy. Let me break down what each line does:

```python
signals.loc[signals['RollingMax'] < signals.trend, 'signal'] = -1
signals.loc[signals['RollingMin'] > signals.trend, 'signal'] = 1
```

## Purpose: Generate Trading Signals Based on Breakouts

**Line 1: Short/Sell Signal (-1)**
- **Condition**: `signals['RollingMax'] < signals.trend`
- **Meaning**: The current price has **broken ABOVE** the previous rolling maximum (the highest price in the last N periods)
- **Action**: Set signal to -1 (SELL or SHORT position)

**Line 2: Long/Buy Signal (1)**
- **Condition**: `signals['RollingMin'] > signals.trend`
- **Meaning**: The current price has **broken BELOW** the previous rolling minimum (the lowest price in the last N periods)
- **Action**: Set signal to 1 (BUY or LONG position)

## The Trading Logic

This appears to be a **counter-trend or mean-reversion** variant:
- When price breaks above recent highs → Expect reversal down (sell)
- When price breaks below recent lows → Expect reversal up (buy)

**Note**: The classic Turtle Trading Strategy typically does the opposite (buy on breakouts above highs, sell on breakouts below lows). This implementation seems to be using a contrarian approach, betting on mean reversion rather than trend continuation.

Perfect! Now I can see the full context. Here's the complete picture:

## The Purpose: **Breakout Detection for Trading Signals**

These lines detect when the price **breaks out** of its recent trading range:

```python
signals.loc[signals['RollingMax'] < signals.trend, 'signal'] = -1  # Price broke ABOVE recent high
signals.loc[signals['RollingMin'] > signals.trend, 'signal'] = 1   # Price broke BELOW recent low
```

### The Strategy Setup:

```python
signals['signal'] = 0.0
signals['trend'] = df['Close']                                      # Current prices
signals['RollingMax'] = signals.trend.shift(1).rolling(count).max() # Highest price in last 'count' days (excluding today)
signals['RollingMin'] = signals.trend.shift(1).rolling(count).min() # Lowest price in last 'count' days (excluding today)
```

### What It's Detecting:

1. **Signal = -1 (SELL)**: When today's price is **higher** than the maximum price of the previous `count` days
   - This is an **upside breakout** 
   - Could indicate: overbought condition, time to take profits, or short

2. **Signal = 1 (BUY)**: When today's price is **lower** than the minimum price of the previous `count` days
   - This is a **downside breakout**
   - Could indicate: oversold condition, time to buy the dip

This appears to be a **contrarian/mean-reversion** strategy rather than the traditional trend-following Turtle strategy. It assumes that extreme breakouts will reverse back to the mean.
